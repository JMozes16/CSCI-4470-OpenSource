It's important to keep working on your final projects so that you do not fall behind. This project represents a large portion of your final grade and you will learn many useful skills from working on it. Do not be afraid to ask for help if you are having problems/struggling. We all want you to succeed and do well so do not hesitate to ask a mentor or Professor Turner for help!

    One member of each group should post the following information to the Projects Channel on Discord

        Project Name

        Link to the Observatory https://rcos.io/projects page for your project. If you don't have one, please make one. Ask us if you don't know how to do this.

        Link to your blog (It is recommended use the observatory blogging feature).

        Link to the Github repository of your project.

        List of collaborators on the project

    Starting next Monday you should be updating the blog with one post per person per week and committing at least 3-4 times per person to your repository. Blogging is important as it will help us to track your progress as well as keep you on track towards achieving all the goals you have set out for yourself, so not neglect this aspect of the project!

<!    Also next week we will begin doing quick interim presentations on your project. Be sure to follow the [InterimReport.md](InterimReport.md) guidelines.>
