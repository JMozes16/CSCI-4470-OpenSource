\item Short answers (18 pts)

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Richard Stallman defines free software as possessing four essential freedoms. Please list them below. (12 pts)

\beginanswers
\begin{itemize}
\item Freedom 0) Freedom to run the program for any purpose
\item Freedom 1) Freedom to study the program how it works and change to your likes (Access to the source code is a precondition)
\item Freedom 2) Freedom to distribute copies to others so that they can benefit
\item Freedom 3) Freedom to distribute modified versions of the code so that others can benefit from your contributions.

	\item Open source licenses generally fall into two basic types: Copyleft and Permissive. Please  define Copyleft and Permissive licenses below. (6 pts)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The characteristics of a Copyleft license are:

		\item The characteristics of a Permissive license are:

\item Please indicate whether each of the following licenses or licensing scenarios results in a  permissive, copyleft, proprietary or public domain (12 points):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Licensed with GPL:
\bigskip
\bigskip
\item Licensed with BSD:
\bigskip
\bigskip
\item An integration of two open source projects one licensed copyleft and the other licensed permissive:
\bigskip
\bigskip
\item No license:

\end{enumerate}

\item For each question below, circle the best answer (12 pts)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which command shows you a summary of all commits into a git repository?
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item git branch
		\item git status
		\item git checkout newbranch
		\item git log
	\end{enumerate}
\newpage
 	\item Literate programming:
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item Is well structured code with minimal comments
 		\item Cannot express complicated algorithms
 		\item Mixes code and comments in an easily human readable format
 		\item Is a failed development methodology
 	\end{enumerate}
 	\item Open or Free software:
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item Cannot be used for a commercial purpose
 		\item Can be redistributed either for free or for a fee
 		\item Can be sold, but only for the nominal cost of the media used to store it
 		\item Must be maintained by unpaid volunteers
 	\end{enumerate}
 	\item It is a good idea when selecting an open source license to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Go to an authority such as the OSI and pick an approved license
		\item Create a new license from scratch because it is unlikely that an existing license would meet your needs
		\item Just place the code in a public repository. Easily available code is the same as open
		\item Take an existing, approved license and modify to better represent your unique personality
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item Give a sequence of git commands to accomplish the following (you can assume that you are always working on the ``master'' branch'') (15 pts):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a new git repository on your local machine.
	\item Assume you have a new file ``foo.txt'' in your local directory. Add this file to your repository.
	\item Set up your repository to communicate with a public repository at ``https://www.mypublicrepository/public.git''
	\item Send your changes to the public repository
	\item Assume someone else makes changes to the repository. Add the changes in the public repository into your local version. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Assume you have 3 source files a main file ``prog.c'' and two additional files``f1.c'', and ``f2.c'' containing code that ``prog'' depends upon. Write a Makefile that creates object files for all 3 sources, creates a library containing the code from ``f1.c'' and ``f2.c'', and then appropriately creates an executable named ``prog.exe''. Make sure your Makefile contains appropriate ``all'' and ``clean'' targets. (15 pts):
