Quiz 1  &nbsp;  \n\

\n\
        * Submitty will open for a 90 minute submission period beginning at the start of \n\
          class at 12:20 pm ET and will remain open until 4:20 pm ET. You \n\
          are expected to start close to the 12:20 start time and complete within the 90 minute \n\
          test window. The additional time is to account for students with accommodations and to \n\
          give some slack for technical difficulties. \n\
        * Professor Turner will be hanging out in Nook \n\
          https://app.nooks.in/goto/qS7SgQTAyogWfILY?pwd=4o647S \n\
          until at least 3:20. \n\
        * After clicking continue, the test will start and you will have 90 minutes to \n\
          complete the test (135 minutes for 50% accommodations or 180 minutes for 100% \n\
          accommodations).\n\
        * Leaving the page does not stop the timer.\n\
        * If you submit your answers more than 90 minutes (135 minutes for 50% accomodation \n\
          or 180 minutes for 100% accommodation) after your first page access, you will \n\
          lose 1 point per minute over the limit.\n\
        * If you run over your allotted time please submit as soon as possible. Do not wait\n\
          to contact us to get permission.  The later your submission, the greater the penalty.\n\
          If you run into a technical issue that prevents you from submitting, immediately \n\
          email Prof. Turner at turnew2@rpi.edu. Attach your exam to the \n\
          email and briefly but thoroughly explain the issue. Depending on when you email us and\n\
          the issue, we will decide whether or not to apply a penalty.\n\
        * There are 6 questions on this test. The allocated points are specified with each \n\
          problem. Each question should be submitted to the correct submission box in the \n\
          Exam 1 gradeable on Submitty. These will not be auto-graded. \n\
          Therefore, you will not see any points once you submit. \n\
        * During the exam,  if you are doubtful/confused about a problem, simply state your assumptions \n\
          and/or interpretation as comments right before your code and write your solution accordingly.\n\
        * During exam time, you should NOT contact any of the TAs or mentors either via email or \n\
          on the discussion forum.  In case of an extremely urgent situation please email \n\
          Prof. Turner.\n\
        * Students MUST make sure they have a steady internet connection before the exam \n\
        * This is an open book, open notes and open reference material exam. You may NOT discuss\n\
          any portion of this exam with any person during the exam period. DO NOT use Google, DO \n\
          NOT consult any resources such as Stack Overflow. You may use class notes,\n\
          or any of the local tools you installed for labs.\n\
        * By submitting this test, you are certifying that you agree with and will abide by \n\
          the honor code for the course below\n\
