# Project Interim Report

We will have presentations on your projects during class beginning on 3/15 and running until everyone has presented. I currently have 17 - 19 projects on the schedule. We will plan on 3-5 minutes per project. Please prepare 1-3 slides covering:

* Your project title
* Team members
* Your description and goals for the semester
    * Make sure you differentiate work done for this course from any work done for another course or for independent study
* Project organization (see the PROJECT rubric)
* Contributions (expected to be minor at this point, but see the PROJECT rubric)
* Progress / issues to date (expected to be small)

The goal will be to take 30 minutes out of next lecture (end) and next lab (beginning) to get through everybody. I picked the order teams show up in Submitty:

* 00006_hongj8
