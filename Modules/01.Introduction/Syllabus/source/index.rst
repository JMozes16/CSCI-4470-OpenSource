Meetings
---------

The course will meet in **Sage 5510** on Tuesdays and Fridays from 10:30pm - 12:35pm. Class discussions are an important part of the lecture and the labs so attendance is required. If you are temporarily unable to attend because of quarantine or other health issues, please contact Prof. Turner and make alternate arrangements.


Overview
================

Reading Material
----------------

Most lectures will have a reading section. You should be reading this as we go along. Additionally, you are encouraged to check out the resources contained in the file

* `CSCI-4470-OpenSource/Resources/Reading-Material.md <https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource/blob/master/Resources/Reading-Material.md>`_,

Online LMS and the use of Submitty
----------------------------------

This course **will not** use the RPI Blackboard LMS. Instead, we will use **Submitty** a course management tool developed as an opensource project under **RCOS** and the creative and technical auspices of Prof. Barbara Cutler. If you are registered in the course, you may access it at https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu/courses/u22/csci4470. If you do not have access, please email the TA or the Professor.

Goal of this Class:
-------------------

- Familiarize students with open source software development
- Have them be familiar with and eager to learn new technology stacks
- Able to Read and Understand Good Code.
- Patch an existing open source project. 
- Work on a team collaborative project. 
- Become aware of and conversant in team project and diversity issues. 
- Prepare a new RCOS project for the following semester.

Learning Outcomes:
-------------------

The goal of this course is to provide a strong foundation in open source software development
in preparation for jobs in industry or for more advanced courses.

- Understanding of Open Source Software Tools and Community

Policies

Attendance
----------

Regular attendance and participation is expected. 

Missed Exams or Assignments
---------------------------

A formal excused absence is required to make up a missed assignment or to turn in an assignment after the due date.

Integrity
=========

Policy
--------

Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process.

In this course, collaboration in your project group (3 or 4 students) is allowed, but should not be abused. Do not copy blindly. Labs and Quizzes should be solved and written by individuals alone. If anyone is caught cheating, severe measures will be taken such as lowering the final grade, and the event will be reported to the appropriate authorities in the campus.

.. nextslide::

The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the Graduate Student Supplement (For 6000 level and above courses) define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these. All assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the student’s own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration. Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy will result in (1) an academic (grade) penalty and (2) reporting to the Dean of Academic Affairs and either the Dean of Students (for Undergraduates) or the Dean of Graduate Education (for Graduate students).

.. nextslide::

In this course, the academic penalty for a first offense is loss of a letter grade. A second offense will result in failure of the course.
If you have any questions concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification.
